🏗️ Homepage Hierarchy Explained in Simple Words

1. Hero Section (Top Fold)

This is the very first thing users see when they land.

Heading = company’s main promise (SEO keyword).

Subtext = your value proposition.

Visual = premium looping video/animation montage (you already have VR projects).

CTAs = “Start Your Project” + “View Our Work.”

👉 This came from the PDF’s intro text + project showcase images.

2. Trusted By / Clients

A row with client logos (MOE, Border Guard, Expo, Vision 2030).

Builds instant trust.

👉 These logos/clients were listed in the PDF.

3. Services Overview

Snapshot of the company’s main offerings (Digital Transformation, 3D Animation, Gamification, etc.).

CTA to full Services page.

👉 The services list is directly from the PDF.

4. Industries Served

Grid layout: Real Estate, Events, Education, Healthcare, Defense, etc.

CTA to Industries page.

👉 Straight from the “industries served” section in the PDF.

5. Featured Projects / Portfolio

Highlight 3 big projects with visuals: Ancient Makkah VR, Border Guard Simulation, Expo Booths.

CTA to Portfolio page.

👉 Directly from the PDF’s case studies/projects.

6. Testimonials / Impact Stories

Short client quotes or video testimonials.

Builds social proof.

👉 The PDF mentioned impact & client results, so I structured it as testimonials.

7. Why Choose AO Interactive (Differentiators)

3–4 pillars explaining what makes the company special.

Example: Vision 2030 alignment, VR/AR expertise, proven government work, full-cycle delivery.

👉 Comes from the company mission & selling points in the PDF.

8. Blog / Insights (Optional)

Content marketing for SEO.

Future-proof section: articles about VR, training, etc.

👉 The PDF mentioned thought leadership & innovation → turned into blog preview.

9. Final Call-to-Action

Before footer → strong “Book a Consultation” CTA.

👉 PDF repeatedly pushed getting clients to start projects → so I put CTA here.

🔎 So, in short

The PDF had the raw material (services, industries, projects, testimonials, mission, Vision 2030).

I converted it into a proper homepage flow that any modern corporate website should follow.

This way, instead of being scattered info in PDF slides, it’s now a user journey:
Problem → Solution → Proof → Trust → CTA.
